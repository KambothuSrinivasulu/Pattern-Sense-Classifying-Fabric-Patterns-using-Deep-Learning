# Pattern-Sense-Classifying-Fabric-Patterns-using-Deep-Learning
Pattern Sense is a deep learning project designed to automatically classify fabric patterns from images using convolutional neural networks. It streamlines the process of identifying common pattern types—such as stripes, florals, and geometrics—making it valuable for textile, fashion, and retail industries.
